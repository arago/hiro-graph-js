# HIRO Graph JavaScript Libraries 

These libraries are for interacting with the HIRO Graph API. For full details of the API see the [HIRO Graph Docs](https://docs.hiro.arago.co/hiro/current/developer/hiro-graph-api/).

## Packages

All the packages here are available on npm. Check the [packages](packages/) directory for the full list.

Each package maintains it's own documentation:

- [`@hiro-graph/client`](/packages/hiro-graph-client/)

## Development

To work on these packages, a tool called `lerna` is used. To get up and running:

```
$ yarn
$ yarn lerna -- bootstrap
```
